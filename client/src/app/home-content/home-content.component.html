        <h1>Welcome to a TL;DR showcase of NY Bass fishing baits.</h1>
        <p>
            I'd like to share what is currently
            is working for me (as a successful tournament angler).
            <br>
            This is as much of a journal for me to look back on as it is
            (hopefully) helpful for other anglers out there!

            But here is what was working the 2nd
            week of December (2022):
